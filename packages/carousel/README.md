# Valence Carousel

The Valence Carousel is a custom horizontal carousel component designed for maximum usability in desktop and mobile environments. It allows a user to interact with it via the browser's native horizontal scroll, by clicking and dragging, and with the controls on either side. This component is based closely on the image carousel in the Instagram Threads app.
