/**
 * This system is the natural successor to the `ReactiveProps` system, but is much
 * more powerful and better for DX. No longer do individual properties need to specify
 * that they are reactive; instead an entire type can be passed into the `Responsive<T>`
 * type and every property will be made responsive.
 *
 * Additionally, when used as props, the `Responsive<T>` type can be passed into a
 * `getResponsiveProps` function that will automatically handle the responsive logic
 * and return the correct prop for this context.
 *
 * Responsive props will not consider the current *platform*, and will only consider
 * the screen size. This is because platforms (such as iOS) may have different screen
 * sizes, and thus will need to adapt.
